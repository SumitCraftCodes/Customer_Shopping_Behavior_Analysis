🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

A Data Analytics Project using Python, MySQL, and Power BI

📌 Overview

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of customer shopping behavior using 3,900 retail transactions. It aims to understand spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, discount usage, and subscription impact. The workflow includes data cleaning and preprocessing in Python (handling missing ratings, standardizing columns, and creating new features such as age groups and purchase frequency), loading the cleaned data into MySQL, and performing structured business analysis through SQL queries—covering revenue insights, top products, discount dependency, shipping-type comparisons, subscriber vs. non-subscriber behavior, and segmentation of customers into New, Returning, and Loyal categories. The project concludes with an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes KPIs, product performance, demographic insights, and customer behavior trends. Recommendations include strengthening loyalty programs, optimizing discount strategies, boosting subscriptions, and targeting high-value customer groups to improve business growth.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
